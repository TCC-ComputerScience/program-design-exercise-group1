struct battleship {
  bool shipRandomizer[][] //The true and false values of this array will determine where the ships will be placed on the 10x10 grid by random
  char battleMap[][] //This will print the entirety of the map and will change based on whther a ship has been hit or not
  int ROW_MAX = 10; //Maximum row size
  int COL_MAX =10; //Maximum Column size
  };
  
  Michael: My general idsea with this structure is to randomly assign bool values to the shipRandomizer, and have a
  function where the user inputs a location and a function will seach through shipRandomizer to see if the coordinates 
  in the array equal true. If the coodrinate is true it will print  "H", or if false then '.' will print on the map. 
  Can someone explain the main use of the # symbol please? Fell free to add onto this list if you have anymore quaestions or ideas.
